# Motor Simulation

This project is a basic engine power curve simulation developed in Python.
It models the relationship between engine RPM and power using a simplified
torque function.

This project was created by a high school student in 4th semester,
as an introductory exploration of automotive engineering and programming.

##  What does it do?
- Simulates engine torque behavior
- Calculates engine power from RPM
- Visualizes the power curve using Python

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

##  How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install numpy matplotlib
3. Run the script:
   python motor_sim.py

##  Author
High school student (4th semester) interested in automotive engineering,
mechanical systems, and programming.
